# webflow-first-practice
I will implement a 10-day training plan for the Webflow platform, the outcomes of which will be three goals: 

- Creating a full-fledged project 
- Certification on the Webflow website and obtaining a certificate 
- Work on a real project in a team 

In this repository, I am creating a folder with a screenshot of a one-page website where I tried different tools. I created a section and containers, a header, an article title, a quote, paragraphs and an image. I placed the logo on the left side of the website. 
Problems I encountered: 
- The logo disappears in the preview of the site. Perhaps the header is overlapping it. 
I can't add the Pro and Contact pages

Summary: 
The task is complete at this stage
